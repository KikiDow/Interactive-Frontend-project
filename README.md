########## Application Purpose #################################################
This one page frontend web application was developed as part completion of the 
Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course. It is the milestone project for the 
Interactive Frontend Development stream.

########## Application Description #############################################
The application follows the project brief and presents a version of the classic
Simon Says game developed using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

########## Files Included ######################################################

style.css
simon.js
Brain_Image.jpeg

########## Design Decisions & Considerations ###################################
1 - The application has attempted to meet all the requirements laid out in the 
assignment outline and design brief. No additional features were added outside of
the design brief.
2 - Although the original electronic version of the game was released in 1978, the 
Developer decided to use a 1980's themed colour scheme inspired by the movie 
"Ready Player One". This was done to challenge the my own skills and to present a 
different design than that to the countless examples available online.

########## Resources ###########################################################
